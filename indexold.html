    <p>Financial decision influences both individuals and organisations and an understanding of finance seems to me to be one of the most important ways in which resources can be managed and generated.
         Having pursued an educational course that has combined creative thinking with strong analytical problem solving skills and attention to the practical concerns of business, I have seen, first hand, how understanding technology, finance and business is essential to success in any field.

            To further enhance my knowledge and keep up to date with the latest digital and technology as well as personal finance in the commercial world, I frequently watch business and technology news and tv programmes and read quality newspapers. The information I get from these sources helps me to understand whatâ€™s going on in the commercial world we live in and to also gain a different perspective on current economic events and issues.
            
            Overall, I consider myself to be a hardworking, determined student who is motivated by challenges and can gain personal benefit from new experiences. I am keen to extend my knowledge, skills and understanding while learning from others and working with them.</p>
